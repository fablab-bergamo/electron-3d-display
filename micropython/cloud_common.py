"""Hardware-agnostic orbital point-cloud logic, shared between the ESP32
firmware (orbital_view.py) and the PC debug simulator (pc/orbital_view_pc.py).
No framebuf/display/st7789py/machine imports here on purpose -- this module
must import cleanly under both real MicroPython and CPython (see
pc/micropython_shim.py), so it stays float-only and hardware-free. ESP32-
specific concerns (Q8 fixed-point conversion, RGB565 packing, viper
rendering) live in orbital_view.py; PC-specific rendering lives in
pc/orbital_view_pc.py. Both call into this module for the same sampling,
ranking, scale-from-radii, and point-turnover logic, so changing the
algorithm once changes it for both.
