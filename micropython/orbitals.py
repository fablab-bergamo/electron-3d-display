"""Hydrogen atomic orbital math: associated Legendre polynomials, associated
Laguerre radial wavefunction, and their composition into a real orbital
wavefunction psi_real(r, theta, phi).

Ported function-by-function from quantum-physics.js (c) 2020-2022 Manuel
Joffre, www.quantum-physics.polytechnique.fr (see examples/js-calculations/
and tools/orbitals_host/ for the JS reference and the cross-validation
harness used to verify this port against it).

Same algorithms as src/physics/orbitals.h/.cpp (the C++ port), renamed to snake_case
per Python convention, so the two can be compared directly -- this module
exists to let the "MicroPython on ESP32" firmware option be evaluated against
the "C++/ESP-IDF" option before committing to either. Written against the
subset of the language/stdlib available under MicroPython's unix port
(plain lists instead of numpy, only the `math` module), so it runs
unmodified under both MicroPython and CPython 3.

Note on precision: MicroPython's *unix* port (used here for host-side
validation) is commonly built with double-precision floats, as confirmed by
tools/orbitals_host/README.md's float-precision probe. The actual ESP32
MicroPython firmware may default to single-precision floats instead (board
and build dependent) -- verify on the target board/firmware before treating
this module's on-PC precision as representative of what will run on the
device.

Optimized per docs.micropython.org/en/latest/reference/speed_python.html:
module-level aliases for `math` functions (avoids a global-module lookup
plus an attribute lookup on every call -- real cost across the ~1001-sample
loops these functions run in), loop-invariant constants hoisted out of
per-sample loops, and `@micropython.native` on every hot function (compiles
to native machine opcodes instead of bytecode, ~2x per the docs; safe here
since none of these functions raise without an argument or need the
background scheduler, the two documented native-emitter restrictions).
`@micropython.native` is MicroPython-only syntax -- it's a compile-time
pragma the MicroPython compiler recognizes by literal spelling
(`micropython.native`), not a real importable decorator, so there's no
`try/except ImportError` shim that preserves it. This module is no longer
plain-Python-compatible as a result (previously true but never actually
exercised by tools/orbitals_host/, which only ever runs it under real
MicroPython) -- a deliberate tradeoff of that unused property for a real,
measured speedup on the actual target.
