"""Point cloud generation for hydrogen orbitals, built on top of the
wavefunction engine in orbitals.py. This is the M2 step mentioned in
CLAUDE.md Sections 5/7: given a validated psi_real(), draw points
(x, y, z) distributed according to the probability density
|psi_{n,l,m}(r,theta,phi)|^2 * r^2 * sin(theta) (the r^2*sin(theta) factor is
the spherical-coordinates volume element, so points end up distributed in
*physical* probability, not just where |psi| happens to be large).

Samples r, theta, phi from three INDEPENDENT precomputed inverse-CDF
(quantile) tables rather than rejection sampling. This is exact, not an
approximation: the target density factors as
    |psi|^2 * r^2 * sin(theta) = [r*R(r)]^2 * [P_l^m(theta)^2*sin(theta)] * azimuthal(phi)^2
i.e. a product of three single-variable functions, so sampling each marginal
independently and combining the results reproduces the joint density exactly
(the same factorization a prior separable-rejection version -- preserved in
git history -- exploited). Each marginal's inverse CDF is built once per
orbital with a single monotonic forward sweep (no per-point search), so
sampling a point costs exactly three table lookups (interpolated, O(1)) plus
the trig to convert to Cartesian -- no rejection loop anywhere, so no
variance in per-point cost and no interpreter loop overhead per point. This
refines an earlier per-axis *rejection* version (also preserved in git
history) the same way stef1949/Electron-Orbital-Simulator's GPU sampler does
it: precompute the inverse function itself, not just the CDF, so there's no
search at sample time either.

Same three-way porting/cross-check discipline as orbitals.py: a small
portable PRNG (XorShift32) is mirrored bit-for-bit in src/physics/pointcloud.h/.cpp
and tools/orbitals_host/js_reference.js, so the same seed produces the same
accepted point sequence across all three ports -- see tools/orbitals_host/
for the cross-check that relies on this.

Optimized per docs.micropython.org/en/latest/reference/speed_python.html,
same techniques as orbitals.py (see that module's docstring for the
`@micropython.native` / CPython-compatibility tradeoff, which applies here
too), plus one more: the three inverse-CDF tables and the scratch weight/cdf
arrays used to build them are `array.array('d', ...)` instead of `list`.
MicroPython's `list` stores each element as a separately heap-allocated
boxed object; `array.array` packs raw doubles into one contiguous buffer, so
building a table (1001 elements, done 3x per orbital in init_orbital_sampler
plus 2x more per table in _build_inverse_cdf's scratch cdf/inv_table -- ~9000
element-writes total per orbital) avoids thousands of small allocations and
the GC pressure they create. Typecode 'd' (not 'f') is deliberate: on the
unix port (double-precision floats, used for the tight cross-check gate)
'f' would silently truncate every stored value to float32, masking real
precision loss as if it were a formatting artifact; 'd' preserves full
double precision there. On the actual ESP32 build (float32-only), 'd' costs
nothing extra -- every float on that build is already single-precision
under the hood, array typecode notwithstanding (verified empirically: 'd'
and 'f' arrays round-trip identically on that board).

Viper (the other code-emitter docs.micropython.org describes, promising
still more speed for integer/bitwise code -- and XorShift32.next() is
exactly that) was deliberately NOT applied here. Its typed integers are a
different underlying representation than plain Python ints, and this
project's entire cross-language validation strategy depends on XorShift32
producing bit-identical output to the C++ and JS ports for the same seed;
a subtle wraparound/representation mismatch in viper's integer semantics
could silently break that without changing any *visible* behavior enough to
notice casually. Not worth the risk for one function already sped up by
`@micropython.native` (which does not change integer semantics, only how
the same operations are executed) -- revisit only if profiling on real
hardware shows XorShift32 itself is now the bottleneck.
