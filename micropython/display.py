"""Display bring-up for the Waveshare ESP32-S3-LCD-1.3 board used in this
project (see CLAUDE.md sections 2-3 for hardware/pinout background).

Pins match the verified TFT_eSPI config in platformio.ini (same physical
board, C++ port):
    SPI:       SCLK=40  MOSI=41  CS=39  DC=38  RST=42
    Backlight: GPIO20, active HIGH

Uses machine.SPI (hardware SPI peripheral, not SoftSPI/bit-bang) at 40 MHz,
the same frequency verified stable for this panel in the C++ port.

machine.SPI(2, ...) hangs this specific board on init (watchdog reset,
verified empirically against the real device -- v1.28.0,
ESP32_GENERIC_S3-SPIRAM_OCT firmware); SPI(1) works fine at 40 MHz, so that
is used here instead. No MISO pin is wired (the display is write-only), so
it is left unset -- machine.SPI defaults it to an unused GPIO internally
without driving the actual display wiring.

Panel-mirror + color-order fix: this exact panel is horizontally mirrored in
a way tft.setRotation()'s four proper rotations cannot undo (see CLAUDE.md
"Correzione verificata: mirror pannello e ordine colore" -- proven both
mathematically and empirically in the C++ port / examples/corner_calibration/).
The fix is a raw MADCTL write with only the MX bit set (not MX|MY), plus BGR
(not RGB) color order. st7789py.py's custom_rotations lets us express this
directly instead of picking from its four built-in rotation presets (none of
which is MX-only): one rotation entry with madctl=MX; st7789py itself ORs in
the BGR bit when color_order=BGR.

On top of that mirror fix, this unit's prism mount also needs a plain 180
degree rotation to line the image up with the physical viewing angle --
verified on-device with main.py's corner test: sprite corners were landing
on their diagonally-opposite physical corner (e.g. sprite top-left drawn red
came out physically bottom-right), the same 180 degree offset
examples/corner_calibration/README.md found for the C++ port.

Tried doing that 180 in hardware via MADCTL (MY on top of the existing MX,
using this driver's own built-in 240x240 rotation-table offset of
ystart=80 for madctl=0xc0) -- on-device it produced a corrupted image
(quadrants shuffled asymmetrically, not a clean 180), so this ST7789
variant's RAM-window addressing does not behave like the generic four-way
rotation table assumes for this combination. Reverted to the known-good
MX-only addressing (positions correctly, just needs a software 180) and
apply the 180 degree flip in the drawing code instead, exactly like
examples/corner_calibration.ino does for the C++ port: use
`to_physical(x, y)` below to convert a sprite-space coordinate to the
coordinate that lands in that physical spot, and draw there.
