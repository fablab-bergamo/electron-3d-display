"""Multi-electron atom point-cloud approximation, built on top of
orbitals.py/pointcloud.py's hydrogenic math and slater.py's effective-
nuclear-charge model. Platform-agnostic (no PC- or device-only imports),
consumed by both pc/atom_view_pc.py and micropython/atom_view.py -- the
latter is not the default boot animation (see main.py's docstring), but the
model itself needs no adaptation to run on-device.

Model, in one paragraph: for atomic number Z, fill subshells by the Madelung
rule with the known real-world exceptions applied
(slater.electron_configuration() / slater._CONFIG_EXCEPTIONS), give every
electron in a subshell the SAME effective nuclear charge Z_eff used in the
radial substitution r -> Z_eff*r (slater.z_eff_radial(): the refined
Clementi-Raimondi Hartree-Fock Z_eff where the table covers the subshell,
else Slater's rules rescaled by n/n* -- Slater's n* consistency; one value
per subshell, not per electron). A FULL subshell's contribution is sampled
as spherically symmetric (pointcloud.sample_isotropic_point()) -- exact via
Unsoeld's theorem (summing |Y_l^m|^2 over every m in a filled subshell gives
a constant). A subshell that is NOT full is instead expanded into its
individually-occupied real orbitals per Hund's rule
(slater.hund_fill_m()) and each sampled with the SAME per-orbital sampler
the hydrogen presets use (pointcloud.sample_orbital_point(), Z_eff-scaled --
see pointcloud.init_orbital_sampler()'s z_eff parameter) -- this is what
gives a partially-filled outer shell (e.g. carbon's 2p2) its real lobed
shape instead of a featureless sphere; treating it as isotropic too, like an
earlier version of this module did, is only exact for full subshells. The
atom's total point cloud is the union of every group's own point cloud,
point count split STRICTLY proportional to how many electrons that group
represents (see _split_counts()) -- no per-group boosting of any kind. An
earlier version of this module multiplied anisotropic (partially-filled)
groups' share by a constant (PARTIAL_SUBSHELL_BOOST) to make their lobed
shape read more clearly against neighboring isotropic groups' density in
the merged view; removed because it broke the (n, ell)-level
point-count/electron-count proportionality pc/atom_view_pc.py's per-subshell
dissection view relies on to be honest -- with the boost, two subshells
holding the SAME electron count (e.g. iron's 3d6 vs 3p6) could render with a
3x DIFFERENT point count purely because one happened to be anisotropic,
which reads as "shell with more electrons has more points" being violated
even though it wasn't, per electron count. A partially-filled subshell can
still look visually weaker than a full one of similar size in the merged
(non-dissection) view as a result -- true again now, same as the version
before the boost existed -- but every point count in this module is now
exactly what the electron count says it should be, in every view.

Coloring: every point's default color (SHELL_RGB) is still by shell
(principal quantum number n) regardless of which path produced it, so the
classic K/L/M/N shell structure reads visually across the whole atom. The
points belonging to the OUTERMOST subshell (outer_subshell_r_ref()'s own
plan[0] -- the same subshell the bounding circle/scale calibration already
treats as "the atom's size", see that function's docstring) are additionally
brightened (_brighten_outer_shell(), toward white) after the fact, while
every OTHER point is dimmed the other way (_dim_inner_shell(), toward black)
to widen the contrast further. Without this, the outer/valence subshell is
easy to miss entirely: for any atom past Ne it is a small minority of the
total point BUDGET too (points are split strictly proportional to electron
count, see _split_counts() -- e.g. potassium's single valence 4s electron is
1 of 19, ~5% of its points), so the correctly-larger valence cloud reads as
visually similar-sized "blob" to every other element's core-dominated cloud
unless its own points are made to stand out individually. Dimming the inner
layers by default is safe, not lossy: each one still gets its own
full-brightness moment when the shell-dissection view (pc/atom_view_pc.py's
D-key sequence) zooms into it specifically -- see below. Every
point ALSO carries a signed-wavefunction sign (see `signs`, below) wherever
one is meaningful: isotropic (full-subshell) groups have none -- angle-
averaging erases it, same reasoning Unsoeld's theorem relies on above -- and
are marked sign=0; anisotropic (Hund's-rule per-orbital) groups DO have a
real signed wavefunction, recovered here by evaluating orbitals.psi_real()
at each sampled point (same z_eff*r substitution the radial table itself
was built with, see init_orbital_sampler()'s docstring) after the fact --
the inverse-CDF sampling that placed the point only ever used |psi|^2,
which loses the sign, so it has to be recomputed, not reused. Not applied
to `colors` itself (still the plain outer-brightened/inner-dimmed SHELL_RGB
above, unconditionally, never phase) since mixing signed/unsigned coloring
across one atom's cloud by default would be more confusing than
informative; instead left for a caller that wants it for a specific purpose
to use `signs` selectively -- see pc/atom_view_pc.py's shell-dissection
view, which swaps to phase coloring
(cloud_common.PHASE_POSITIVE_RGB/PHASE_NEGATIVE_RGB) only for the ONE shell
currently exploded, where "isotropic groups have none" doesn't collide with
anything else on screen -- and only for its anisotropic points; sign=0
points there fall back to that subshell's true (undimmed/unbrightened)
SHELL_RGB, not `colors[i]` -- see render_dissection_frame()'s comment.

No point-turnover/resample here either (unlike cloud_common.ResampleState)
-- the cloud is built once and stays static; see pc/atom_view_pc.py's
module docstring for that tradeoff.

# across the whole Z=1..118 range this model supports -- past Z=54 the
# Slater-fallback path produces a suspicious discontinuity (e.g. Cs's

    "shell 2" entry -- so each orbital gets its own zoom/label instead of
    sharing a scene with whatever else happens to share its principal
    quantum number.

    Ordered by each subshell's own MEASURED p90 radius in THIS point cloud,
    descending (largest/outermost first) -- NOT by (n, ell) quantum-number
    order. Quantum numbers alone don't reliably predict radial extent for
    multi-electron atoms (e.g. the 4s/3d crossover across the transition
    metals: 4s fills before 3d by the Madelung rule but is not always
    outside it once both are occupied); measuring r_ref directly from this
    cloud's own sampled points sidesteps having to encode that ordering by
    hand and stays correct however slater.z_eff_radial() shifts a given
    element's subshells relative to each other.

    Returns a list of (n, ell, letter, subshell_str, electron_count, r_ref):

      - electron_count: this subshell's own occupancy (config already
        stores subshells individually -- no summing across ell needed here,
        unlike the old per-shell version this replaces).
      - r_ref: p90 radius (see _p90_radius()) of THIS subshell's own points
        only, i.e. how far its sampled points actually reach in THIS
        specific point cloud (not a hydrogenic formula) -- what the
