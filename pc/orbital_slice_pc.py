"""Math-validation harness + static PNG preview for the plane-slice heatmap (SLICE.md).

Builds the exact same static-plane cell table src/views/orbital_slice.cpp's
buildSliceTable() builds on-device -- same lobe-plane azimuth ph0, same folded
azimuthal sign flip, same density-normalized brightness mapping (percentile-clipped
|psi|^2 + gamma, see SLICE.md's contrast note) -- using micropython/orbitals.py's
already cross-validated R(r)/P_l^m(theta) primitives, so this script is
checking SLICE.md section 3's *derivation*, not re-deriving the underlying
physics from scratch.

Run before any firmware flash (SLICE.md section 9.1): asserts the section 3
sanity checks (2px/2py dumbbells and their phase split, 2py's slice-at-ph0=0
zero patch, 3dxy's same-phase lobe pair, 3dz2/s-orbital axial symmetry, 2s's
radial node ring), then writes one PNG per checked orbital under
pc/out/slice_preview/ for a by-eye look.

No tkinter window (unlike pc/orbital_view_pc.py) -- this is a one-shot batch
check, not an interactive viewer; PIL alone is enough to produce the PNGs.
