"""Atom-dissection logic SHARED by pc/atom_view_pc.py and web/py/web_atom.py
(fetched into Pyodide the same way pc/render_core.py already is -- see
web/index.html's PY_FILES). No PIL/tkinter/canvas here: AtomPreset is pure
atom_cloud.py model calls, and build_dissection_steps() is pure phase-plan
arithmetic -- neither platform's rendering primitives leak in here, matching
render_core.py's split (render math shared, blit/input stays platform-side).

This module does NOT cover micropython/atom_view.py: the device has no
dissection feature (see that module's own docstring), so there is nothing
to share with it here.

build_dissection_steps() computes the Phase 0-5 scale/clip/timing plan ONCE
as a list of opaque step tuples, so a pacing or ordering change (e.g. to
DISSECT_ZOOM_SLOWDOWN) is made in one place instead of hand-ported across
pc and web separately. Each platform just executes the steps with its own
ease/hold primitive (pc: blocking _dissect_ease()/_dissect_hold(); web:
generators dissect_ease_gen()/dissect_hold_gen()) and its own hold-duration
units (pc: wall-clock seconds; web: a frame count -- hold_duration is never
interpreted here, just threaded through unchanged).
