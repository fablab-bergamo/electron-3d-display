"""PC-only viewer for atom_cloud.py's multi-electron point clouds -- same
tumbling-camera rendering as orbital_view_pc.py's hydrogen-preset viewer
(both built on pc/viewer_common.py's shared render_frame()/draw_orbit_marker()
etc.), but cycling through atomic number Z instead of (n, ell, m) presets.
See pc/README.md's "Multi-electron atoms" section for the model and controls.

    python3 pc/atom_main.py [Z]

Up/Down changes Z live (same fly-over transition as a preset switch); D runs
a one-shot dissection sequence (see AtomViewApp._run_dissection()): the cloud
keeps spinning (roll only -- see AtomViewApp._dissect_tumble()) while the
near half stays clipped away (camera-space clip, but since roll never
changes clip depth, the SAME half stays excluded for the whole sequence
instead of sweeping through fresh material), then the camera zooms subshell
by subshell from outermost to innermost, dimming the others to gray and
phase-coloring the active subshell wherever a sign is defined
(atom_cloud.build_atom_point_cloud()'s `signs`), and finally zooms back out
and un-cuts. No point turnover here -- AtomPreset.resample() is a no-op,
since cloud_common's turnover only knows single-orbital distributions and
this cloud is a mixture of several subshells.

Both this view and the normal (non-dissecting) one also draw a plain gray
bounding-circle outline (draw_bounding_circle(), the neutral
BOUNDING_SPHERE_COLOR -- deliberately not shell-colored) tracking the
reference sphere, so the eye has a recognizable sphere shape to track even
when the active subshell's dimming makes the actual points hard to see.

        shell's own extent) on the last subshell, then back out through the

        longer sequence instead of feeling rushed.
