"""Hartree-Fock-Slater screened-potential atomic solver (offline, PC-only).

Solves every occupied (n, ell) subshell's radial wavefunction of a neutral
atom as an eigenstate of a single central potential built self-consistently
from its own electron density -- the classic central-field approximation
(Herman & Skillman 1963, see pc/screened_potential_model.md for the full
design and references). Replaces the hydrogenic "one Z_eff per subshell"
approximation of micropython/slater.py for the high-Z atom model:

  V(r) = -Z/r + V_ee(r) + V_x(r)
  V_ee: Coulomb potential of the spherically averaged electron density
  V_x : local (Slater) exchange, -3*alpha*(3*rho/(8*pi))^(1/3)
  Latter cutoff: V := min(V, -1/r)  -- restores the physical -1/r tail for
      the outermost electron (removes the Hartree self-interaction error at
      infinity, Latter 1955)

Radial equation (Hartree atomic units, r in Bohr radii), u(r) = r*R(r):

  u'' = [l(l+1)/r^2 + 2(V - E)] u

On a log-uniform grid r = r0*exp(t) with v(t) = r^(1/2)*R(r) this becomes a
clean 1D Schrodinger form without first-derivative term,

  v'' = [l(l+1) + 1/4 + 2(V - E) r^2] v,

i.e. a symmetric tridiagonal generalized eigenproblem A v = E B v
(B = diag(2 r^2)), solved with ARPACK shift-invert
(scipy.sparse.linalg.eigsh) -- see solve_states_l() for why the tridiagonal
LAPACK paths are not used here. Eigenfunctions of the SAME potential with
different n are automatically orthogonal, which reproduces the
core-orthogonality contraction that the hydrogenic model misses.

Numpy/scipy are fine here: this is an offline table generator (like
tools/splash_gen), NOT code that runs on the device or in the shared
micropython/ samplers -- its output feeds those samplers via tabulated
radial functions (see pc/hfs_tables.py).

Usage:
    python3 pc/hfs_solver.py --zmin 1 --zmax 118 --out pc/hfs_tables.npz
    python3 pc/hfs_solver.py --zmin 92 --zmax 92          # single element

        E_n and mode radii against the analytic values
