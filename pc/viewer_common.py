    Checked at the top of every iteration: `app.aborted` (set by the
    launcher's shared Escape-to-return-to-chooser handling, see
    pc/launcher.py and orbital_view_pc.py/atom_view_pc.py's
    _request_exit()). Since the only way `aborted` can flip True mid-call is
    a bound key handler firing during the `app.root.update()` call just
    below, checking here -- immediately before the NEXT frame would render
    -- stops a long fly-over within one frame of Escape instead of running
    it to completion first. Absent on standalone (non-launcher) apps, where
    getattr()'s default keeps this a no-op.

    start_scale/end_scale are also re-scaled live against app.zoom_factor
    every frame (getattr()'s 1.0 default makes this a no-op on the hydrogen
    orbital viewer, which has no manual zoom): app.root.update() below still
    pumps the mouse-wheel/+-/zoom-button handlers even while this loop
    blocks, and those handlers update app.zoom_factor immediately, but
    start_scale/end_scale themselves were captured once by the caller --
    without this rescale a zoom press mid-flight would have no visible
    effect until the animation finished, i.e. the buttons would feel

    scales the two bounds the same way. `shell_count` stretches every leg
