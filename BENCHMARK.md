# Rendering benchmark

`src/debug/benchmark_test.h`/`.cpp` sweeps a fixed atom (Fe, Z=26) AND a fixed orbital preset
(2pz, `kOrbitalDefaultPresetIndex`) across the same several point-cloud sizes, timing real
production-path rendering at each size for both, and logs performance numbers (tagged
`kind,atom` or `kind,orbital` so the two are easy to tell apart in a capture) plus a handful of
deterministic physics numbers (atom sweep only) usable as a correctness regression check. See
that file's header comment for the full rationale.

## How to run it

1. In `src/main.cpp`, comment out whichever `#define` toggle is currently active and uncomment:
   ```c
   #define BENCHMARK_TEST
   ```
2. Build and flash (`-e CYD` also works -- see the "CYD" section below for that board's own,
   smaller point-count range and why):
   ```
   pio run -e WS_ESP32_S3_LCD_1_3 -t upload
   ```
3. Capture serial output (stop once `BENCH,DONE` appears):
   ```
   pio device monitor
   ```
4. Report back the `BENCH,...` lines (or the whole capture) — compare against the "Expected
   results" sections below.
5. When done, re-comment `BENCHMARK_TEST` in `main.cpp` and reflash to return to normal boot
   (chooser menu).

The sweep takes ~16-18 seconds total (5 point-count steps x 60 frames each x 2 sweeps, plus
point-cloud build time per step) and needs no IMU/tilt setup or user interaction.

## Expected results (baseline: 2026-08-22, ESP32-S3 @ 240MHz, SPI 80MHz, this hardware unit)

Re-captured after merging CYD (ESP32-2432S028R) hardware support (`CYD-test` branch): the
`Display` frame buffer went from a single flat array + per-frame software Y-flip to a
block-based allocator with per-pixel `writePx()`/`readPx()` accessors (needed for the CYD's
fragmented, non-PSRAM heap), and every render/font/overlay call site was converted from raw
`uint16_t* frameBuf` to `Display&`. That touches the S3's hot render path too, so this rerun
is also the regression check for that refactor against the previous (2026-08-20) baseline below
-- verdict: **no regression**, every row is flat-to-slightly-faster than 2026-08-20, and
`iram_free`/the physical-correctness tables below are unchanged. `avg_wait_ms` isn't printed by
the summary table below (see the raw `BENCH,STEP` line for it) but stayed flat at ~11-13ms
across every row of both sweeps, as expected for a fixed-size SPI DMA transfer.

### Performance (`BENCH,STEP`)

**Atom sweep (Fe, Z=26):**

| points | build_ms | avg_render_ms | min_render_ms | max_render_ms | fps  | iram_free |
|-------:|---------:|---------------:|---------------:|---------------:|-----:|----------:|
|    500 |      265 |           9.484 |           9.476 |           9.573 | 45.89 |    216687 |
|   1000 |       20 |           9.963 |           9.955 |          10.050 | 45.88 |    216687 |
|   2000 |       24 |          10.926 |          10.914 |          11.031 | 42.08 |    216687 |
|   4000 |       33 |          13.420 |          13.410 |          13.507 | 38.79 |    216687 |
|   8000 |       50 |          17.806 |          17.794 |          17.886 | 33.56 |    216687 |

**Orbital sweep (2pz, `kOrbitalDefaultPresetIndex`):**

| points | build_ms | avg_render_ms | min_render_ms | max_render_ms | fps  | iram_free |
|-------:|---------:|---------------:|---------------:|---------------:|-----:|----------:|
|    500 |      105 |           9.850 |           9.844 |           9.972 | 45.87 |    216387 |
|   1000 |       99 |          10.403 |          10.397 |          10.532 | 45.79 |    216387 |
|   2000 |      114 |          11.520 |          11.506 |          11.652 | 42.00 |    216387 |
|   4000 |      145 |          14.342 |          14.335 |          14.431 | 38.75 |    216387 |
|   8000 |      214 |          19.328 |          19.319 |          19.441 | 31.47 |    216387 |

(500-point atom `build_ms` of 265 is a one-off: the very first sweep step, before Fe's
subshell rejection-sampling has "warmed up" any branch prediction/caches -- every later atom
step, and the whole orbital sweep, doesn't show it. Not a regression signal by itself; watch
whether it recurs at 500 points specifically across runs. Unchanged from the prior baseline,
as expected -- this is startup-order noise, not something the `Display` refactor touches.)

Previous baseline (2026-08-20, same SPI 80MHz -- superseded by the table above, kept for delta
reference): atom @8000pts 18.149ms/31.48fps, orbital @8000pts 19.139ms/31.44fps; see git
history of this file for the full prior tables. (That 2026-08-20 entry's header mislabeled
this as "SPI 40MHz" -- `display.cpp`'s `LCD_PIXEL_CLOCK_HZ` for the S3 target has been
80MHz all along, unchanged by the CYD port; the CYD's own ILI9341 path runs at 40MHz, a
separate `#define` block -- see that file.)

Notes:
- **8000 points is the production count** (`kAtomNumPoints` == `kOrbitalNumPoints`, what
  `atom_view.cpp`/`orbital_view.cpp` actually render) -- the number that matters is the last
  row of each table: **~31-32 FPS for both viewers**, comfortably above the 20-30 FPS target in
  `CLAUDE.md` §6.
- **Orbitals cost noticeably more to build** than atoms at every point count (e.g. 214ms vs.
  50ms at 8000 points) -- expected, since orbital sampling evaluates the radial/angular
  wavefunction per point rather than atom_cloud's simpler per-subshell rejection sampling.
  Render/FPS are nearly identical between the two once built, since both pay the same
  per-point projection/rasterization cost.
- `avg_wait_ms` (blocked on the previous frame's SPI DMA) should stay roughly flat (~12-14ms)
  across all point counts AND both sweeps -- it's dominated by the fixed 240x240x16bit frame
  transfer, not by point count or cloud type. If it scales with point count instead, something
  changed in how/when `presentFrame()`/`waitForFlushDone()` are called.
- `avg_render_ms` (CPU: fade + rotate/project/rasterize + text) should scale roughly linearly
  with point count. A large jump in the 500-point row specifically (which should be cheapest)
  usually means a fixed per-frame cost (e.g. `fadeFrameBuffer()`, title/scale-bar text) grew,
  not a point-cloud regression.
- `build_ms` (point-cloud sampling) growing faster than linearly with point count would suggest
  a regression in the radial/angular sampling rejection rate, not just raw point count.
- `iram_free` should stay flat within each sweep (it does here) -- a downward drift step-to-step
  would flag a leak.
- Re-run and compare after: changing `platformio.ini`'s `SPI_FREQUENCY`, editing
  `camera.h`'s render pipeline (`renderScene`/`renderPointsColored`/`projectPoint`), or editing
  `display.cpp`'s DMA/flush handling.

### Physical correctness (`BENCH,CONFIG` / `BENCH,ZEFF` / `BENCH,GEOM`)

Element: **Fe (Z=26)**. `CONFIG`/`ZEFF` are pure functions of Z (no RNG, no point sampling) --
they must be **bit-identical** on every run on unchanged code. `GEOM` depends on the sampled
points (seeded, so still deterministic per point count) and should match closely but can drift
in the last 1-2 significant digits between unrelated code changes that touch the RNG call order.

**Electron configuration** (must match exactly -- `[Ar] 3d6 4s2`, real ground-state Fe):

| n | ell | occ | label |
|---|-----|----:|-------|
| 1 | 0 | 2 | 1s |
| 2 | 0 | 2 | 2s |
| 2 | 1 | 6 | 2p |
| 3 | 0 | 2 | 3s |
| 3 | 1 | 6 | 3p |
| 4 | 0 | 2 | 4s |
| 3 | 2 | 6 | 3d |

Total = 26 electrons. If this list, the order, or any occupancy changes, that's a regression in
`slater.h`'s `electronConfiguration()`/Madelung filling or `slater_data.h`'s exception table --
blocking, not a rounding issue.

**Z_eff per subshell** (float32 on-device; rtol ~2e-3 vs. a recomputation is fine, exact match
expected between identical builds):

| n | ell | Z_eff |
|---|-----|------:|
| 1 | 0 | 25.381000518798828 |
| 2 | 0 | 18.599000930786133 |
| 2 | 1 | 22.089000701904297 |
| 3 | 0 | 13.675999641418457 |
| 3 | 1 | 12.777999877929688 |
| 4 | 0 | 5.434000015258789 |
| 3 | 2 | 11.180000305175781 |

Sanity shape: monotonically decreasing binding strength from the core (1s, tightest, Z_eff
closest to the true Z=26) out to the valence 4s (Z_eff≈5.4, heavily shielded) -- if 4s ever
comes out with a *higher* Z_eff than 3d/3p, that's a shielding-rule regression, not noise.

**Geometry fingerprint** (outer/valence subshell + its reference radius, per point count):

| points | outer subshell | outer_rref_bohr | base_scale_px |
|-------:|-----------------|-----------------:|---------------:|
|    500 | 4s (n=4, ell=0) |         5.196394 |      18.474348 |
|   1000 | 4s (n=4, ell=0) |         5.522888 |      17.382212 |
|   2000 | 4s (n=4, ell=0) |         5.389955 |      17.810911 |
|   4000 | 4s (n=4, ell=0) |         5.376742 |      17.854677 |
|   8000 | 4s (n=4, ell=0) |         5.411359 |      17.740459 |

`outer_rref_bohr`/`base_scale_px` above are from the 2026-08-20 capture and read noticeably
different from an earlier (2026-08-19) capture of this same table (`outer_rref_bohr` ~6.0-6.2,
`base_scale_px` ~12.0-12.5) -- bigger than the "last 1-2 significant digits" drift this doc
otherwise expects between unrelated changes. `CONFIG`/`ZEFF` matched bit-identically across
both captures, so this isn't a `slater.h`/Z_eff regression; it's localized to the p90-radius
sampling or `kAtomTargetPx`/scale constants, likely from one of the visual-tuning commits
between the two captures (`visual tweaks`, `Improve display buffering and atom overlays`,
etc. -- see `git log -- src/physics/atom_cloud.h src/config/visual_constants.h`). Not
chased down further here; flagging so a future capture doesn't mistake the 2026-08-20 numbers
above for a regression against the (now stale) ~6.0-6.2/~12.0-12.5 figures.

Notes:
- The outer subshell must be **4s at every point count** -- Fe's real valence shell. If it ever
  comes out as 3d (or anything else), that's a bug in `outerSubshellRRef()`'s p90-radius
  comparison or in the point-count split across subshells (`splitCounts()`), not just sampling
  noise.
- `outer_rref_bohr` should converge toward ~6.0-6.2 Bohr radii as point count grows (statistical
  p90 estimate over more samples) -- the 500-point row is the noisiest by design. A value far
  outside ~5.5-6.5 at 8000 points points at a regression in the radial wavefunction/rejection
  sampling for 4s, not just noise.
- `base_scale_px` = `kAtomTargetPx / outer_rref_bohr` (`atom_cloud.h`), so it moves inversely
  with `outer_rref_bohr` -- expect ~12.0-12.5px across all rows.

## CYD (ESP32-2432S028R, no PSRAM, ILI9341 240x320)

Captured 2026-08-28 on real CYD hardware (`pio run -e CYD -t upload`, `BENCHMARK_TEST` toggle
in `main.cpp`), same methodology as the S3 sweep above (`src/debug/benchmark_test.cpp`, same
fixed Fe/2pz targets, same seed) but with two changes required to even boot on this board,
both now baked into `benchmark_test.cpp` itself rather than being one-off hacks for this
capture:

1. **Point-count sweep capped at 1000, not 500-8000.** CYD's `kAtomNumPoints`/
   `kOrbitalNumPoints` (`config/visual_constants.h`) are 1000/3400, not the S3's 12000/12000
   -- no PSRAM to hold a bigger cloud. `kBenchPointCounts` is now branched on
   `CONFIG_IDF_TARGET_ESP32`: `{200, 400, 600, 800, 1000}` on CYD (the smaller of the two
   ceilings, since one array drives both the atom and orbital sweep loops), unchanged
   `{500, 1000, 2000, 4000, 8000}` on the S3. Sweeping the S3's range unmodified on CYD would
   have written past the end of the sweep's own static `atomPoints[]` buffer (sized to the
   swept range, see next point) -- an out-of-bounds write, not just a slow run.
2. **Swept buffers sized to the sweep's own max, not to `kAtomNumPoints`/`kOrbitalNumPoints`.**
   The first attempt at this capture (still sized to the production constants, before point 1
   above too) crashed at boot -- `Display::Display()`'s 240x320 DMA frame-buffer allocation
   failed even at its smallest 1-row/block retry:
   ```
   E (546) display: failed to allocate frame buffer (even at 1 row/block)
   abort() was called at PC 0x400d5d25 on core 0
   ```
   Cause: the sweep's own static scratch (`orbitalPsi2`/`orbitalSigns`/`orbitalLevels`/
   `orbitalPsi2Sorted`, none of which the production `OrbitalPresetState` needs) sized to
   `kOrbitalNumPoints`=3400 added ~34KB of internal-SRAM BSS on top of what normal boot's own
   view state already uses on a board with no PSRAM fallback to absorb it -- enough to
   fragment internal SRAM past the point the block allocator could find contiguous DMA-capable
   space, at any block size. Fixed by introducing `kBenchMaxPoints` (the sweep's own largest
   step, from point 1 -- 1000 on CYD, 8000 on the S3, so no behavior change there) and sizing
   every static buffer in `runBenchmarkTest()` to that instead of the production constants.
   After the fix, the full sweep ran end-to-end with no crash and flat `iram_free` throughout
   (see table below) -- confirmed as the actual fix, not just a plausible-sounding one.

Re-run this capture (and re-check both points above still hold) after: changing
`kBenchPointCounts`, changing `kAtomNumPoints`/`kOrbitalNumPoints` for CYD, or adding any new
static scratch buffer to `runBenchmarkTest()`.

### Performance (`BENCH,STEP`)

**Atom sweep (Fe, Z=26):**

| points | build_ms | avg_render_ms | min_render_ms | max_render_ms | fps   | iram_free |
|-------:|---------:|---------------:|---------------:|---------------:|------:|----------:|
|    200 |       97 |          36.366 |          36.342 |          37.032 | 20.91 |    101364 |

|    800 |       24 |          37.025 |          37.013 |          37.519 | 20.90 |    101364 |
|   1000 |       25 |          37.232 |          37.215 |          37.765 | 20.91 |    101364 |

**Orbital sweep (2pz, `kOrbitalDefaultPresetIndex`):**

| points | build_ms | avg_render_ms | min_render_ms | max_render_ms | fps   | iram_free |
|-------:|---------:|---------------:|---------------:|---------------:|------:|----------:|
|    200 |       30 |          36.726 |          36.713 |          37.397 | 20.91 |    101056 |
|    400 |       50 |          36.963 |          36.951 |          37.440 | 20.90 |    101056 |
|    600 |       60 |          37.212 |          37.202 |          37.663 | 20.90 |    101056 |
|    800 |       69 |          37.452 |          37.439 |          37.934 | 20.91 |    101056 |
|   1000 |       78 |          37.700 |          37.686 |          38.150 | 20.90 |    101056 |

(200-point atom `build_ms` of 97 is the same kind of one-off first-step warmup artifact the S3
table's 500-point row shows, just at a different point count since CYD's sweep starts lower --
not a regression signal by itself.)

Notes:
- **1000 points is the production atom count on this board** (`kAtomNumPoints`); the orbital
  view's production count is 3400 (`kOrbitalNumPoints`), higher than this sweep's 1000-point
  ceiling (capped to the smaller of the two ceilings, see above) -- so the 1000-point orbital
  row here is a lower bound on real orbital cost, not the exact production figure.
- **fps is essentially flat (~20.9) across the whole swept range**, unlike the S3 table where
  fps visibly drops as point count grows. Two compounding reasons: CYD's frame is 33% more
  pixels (240x320=76800 vs the S3's 240x240=57600), and its SPI clock is half the S3's (40MHz
  vs 80MHz, see `display.cpp`) -- so the fixed per-frame cost (whole-frame persistence fade +
  SPI DMA transfer) is both larger in absolute terms and a much bigger share of each frame's
  budget here, dwarfing the point-count-dependent rotate/project/write cost that dominates the
  S3's numbers at low point counts. `avg_render_ms` still climbs slightly with point count
  (36.4ms -> 37.7ms atom, 36.7ms -> 37.7ms orbital) -- the per-point cost is real, just small
  next to the ~36ms fixed floor.
- `avg_wait_ms` (not in the summary table, see the raw `BENCH,STEP` line) drifted mildly
  downward across each sweep (atom: 11.4ms -> 10.6ms; orbital: 11.1ms -> 10.1ms) rather than
  staying flat like the S3's -- small enough (~1ms) to plausibly be scheduling jitter rather
  than a real trend, but flagged in case a future capture shows it growing further.
- `iram_free` stayed exactly flat within each sweep (101364 atom, 101056 orbital) -- no leak
  across steps. The 308-byte gap between the two is `orbitalPoints[]`/scratch vs `atomPoints[]`
  differing in per-point struct size at the same `kBenchMaxPoints`=1000 ceiling, not drift.
- `BENCH,MEM` start (105808 bytes internal free) vs end (101056) shows a one-time ~4.7KB drop,
  not a per-step leak -- consistent with one-off allocations (e.g. the orbital sampler's
  inverse-CDF table, built once on first use) rather than the sweep itself leaking.

### Physical correctness (`BENCH,CONFIG` / `BENCH,ZEFF`)

Bit-identical to the S3 table above (`[Ar] 3d6 4s2`, same seven `Z_eff` values to all 17
significant digits logged) -- expected, since both are pure functions of Z with no RNG or
point sampling, and this is the same `slater.h`/`slater_data.h` code compiled for a different
target. Not re-tabulated here; see the S3 section's tables, this run reproduced them exactly.

`BENCH,GEOM` isn't directly comparable to the S3 table's rows -- different point counts (CYD's
sweep tops out at 1000, the S3's at 8000) and a different seed-consumption path (fewer points
sampled per step), so the outer-subshell reference radius differs by construction, not as a
regression signal. Confirmed the outer subshell is **4s at every step** (correct -- Fe's real
valence shell), same as the S3 run.

## MicroPython (ESP32-S3, 8MB Octal PSRAM)

`micropython/benchmark_test.py` mirrors `src/debug/benchmark_test.cpp`'s methodology exactly, so
the two are directly comparable: same fixed atom (Fe, Z=26), same fixed orbital preset (2p_z,
`cloud_common.ORBITAL_PRESETS[DEFAULT_PRESET_INDEX]` -- index-matched to
`kOrbitalDefaultPresetIndex`), same point-count sweep (500/1000/2000/4000/8000), same seed
(12345, `kAtomCloudSeed`/`cloud_common.SEED`).

### How to run it

```
mpremote connect <port> fs cp -r micropython/. :
mpremote connect <port> exec "import benchmark_test; benchmark_test.run()"
```

### Parity fixes required before these numbers meant anything

Three real mismatches were found and fixed before this comparison was trustworthy -- without
them, MicroPython's numbers looked better than C++'s at low point counts, which was the tell
that something was being measured unfairly rather than MicroPython genuinely being faster:

1. **SPI clock**: `micropython/display.py` was running the panel at 40MHz;
   `src/render/display.cpp`'s `LCD_PIXEL_CLOCK_HZ` for this same S3 target is 80MHz. Bumped to
   match -- `SPI_BAUDRATE = 80_000_000`.
2. **Table-build amortization**: C++'s orbital sampler tables (`kOrbitalLibrary`) and per-`(ell,
   m)` angular tables (`angular_library.h`) are `constexpr`, baked into flash at *compile* time --
   zero runtime cost, every sweep step. MicroPython was rebuilding the equivalent inverse-CDF
   tables from scratch on every single sweep step. Fixed by adding real caches to
   `cloud_common.py` (`_ORBITAL_SAMPLER_CACHE`) and `atom_cloud.py` (`_RADIAL_TABLE_CACHE`/
   `_ANISO_SAMPLER_CACHE`), keyed by `(n, ell, m)` / `(z, n, ell[, m])` -- a genuine production
   improvement (faster element/orbital switching in the live viewers, and in `pc/`, which shares
   these modules), not just a benchmark shortcut. The one-time build cost is still real and is
   reported separately (`BENCH,TABLEBUILD`), paid once before the timed sweep starts, mirroring
   how C++ never pays it during the sweep either.
3. **Render pipeline was doing less work than C++**: `src/render/camera.h`'s `renderScene()`/
   `renderSceneGrouped()` fade the *entire* frame buffer toward black every frame
   (`Display::fade()`, `kPersistenceKeepQ8=160/256`) and alpha-blend every point write against
   whatever's already there (`blendColor565()`, `kElectronAlphaQ8=240/256`) -- not a hard clear
   and opaque overwrite, which is what `device_render_common.py` was doing. Ported both to
   MicroPython (`fade_buffer()` and the blend inside `render_points()`, both
   `@micropython.viper`), using the identical unpack/scale/pack bit formulas as
   `Display::unpackColor565()`/`fadeColor565()`/`blendColor565()` -- cross-checked bit-identical
   against the C++ formulas across 200k random values before trusting it on hardware.

Point-cloud sampling ALGORITHM parity was also checked directly (not just assumed): both sides
use the same inverse-CDF sampling, the same `XorShift32` PRNG, the same 3-draws-per-point order
(`src/physics/pointcloud.{h,cpp}` vs `micropython/pointcloud.py`) -- confirmed identical, so the
build-time gap below is implementation speed (interpreted vs compiled), not different work.

### One-time table-build cost (paid once per element/orbital selection, not per sweep step)

| kind | warm_ms |
|------|--------:|
| atom (Fe subshells) | ~2400-2700 |
| orbital (2p_z sampler) | ~650-660 |

This is what the live viewers' "Loading..." screen covers -- with caching, it now only happens
on the first visit to a given element/orbital per session, not on every switch.

### Performance (`frames_per_step=30` -- half the C++ side's 60; FPS already converges well
before 60 samples, and MicroPython's per-point sampling cost below makes the full schedule
noticeably slower to capture, so this was halved to keep capture time reasonable)

`avg_compute_ms`/`avg_blit_ms` are the MicroPython analogue of C++'s `avg_render_ms`/
`avg_wait_ms`, but the underlying mechanism differs: `st7789py.py`'s `blit_buffer()` is a
synchronous blocking SPI write (no DMA-kickoff-then-wait-later split like
`Display::presentFrame()`/`waitForFlushDone()`), so `avg_blit_ms` is the SPI transfer alone and
`avg_compute_ms` is everything else (fade + proton marker + rotate/project/blend + title/scale
bar), still excluding the blit.

(*C++'s own 500pt atom row has a one-off 265ms branch-prediction warmup artifact, documented
above; the 1000pt row's 20ms is the representative "warm" figure.)

### Interpretation

- **Render path**: once the animation is doing genuinely equivalent per-frame work (fade +
  alpha-blend, matching C++ bit-for-bit), MicroPython is consistently ~3x slower than C++ at
  every point count -- `@micropython.viper`'s Q8-fixed-point loop is fast for an interpreted
  target, but not compiled-native fast, and the persistence fade (57,600 pixels touched every
  frame, independent of point count) is now the dominant per-frame cost. `avg_blit_ms` is flat
  at ~13.1ms on both platforms, confirming the SPI-clock fix closed that gap specifically -- the
  remaining FPS gap is compute, not the display transfer.
- **Build/sampling path**: MicroPython is ~100x slower for atom sampling and ~34x slower for
  orbital sampling at 8000 points, even after caching (eliminating the C++-side's
  compile-time-embedded-table advantage), `@micropython.native` on the hot loops, and inlining
  the color-encoding math to avoid losing native speedup on nested non-native calls. Applying
  those three optimizations took the atom build from 7670ms to 5227ms (-32%) and the orbital
  build from 13139ms to 7220ms (-45%) at 8000 points, measured against the original
  uncached/unoptimized MicroPython numbers -- and that's despite the optimized numbers now
  correctly *including* the per-point color-encoding step, which the original measurement had
  silently left untimed. This residual gap (an interpreter, even an optimized one, doing
  per-point trig/branchy Python vs compiled C++) is expected and would need inlining
  `sample_orbital_point()`/`psi_real()` themselves to close further -- not done, since those are
  cross-validated against the C++ and JS reference ports (`tools/orbitals_host/`) and duplicating
  them inline is a real correctness risk for marginal further gain.
- One-time table cost (~2.4-2.7s for Fe, ~0.65s for 2p_z) is a real, one-off "Loading..." delay
  on first visit to an element/orbital per session, not a per-frame cost -- cached for every
  later revisit.

### Fade/blend now disabled by default on MicroPython (re-captured 2026-08-27)

The sweep above was captured with `micropython/device_render_common.py`'s `PERSISTENCE_KEEP_Q8`/
`ELECTRON_ALPHA_Q8` forced to match the C++ side (160/240) specifically for that apples-to-apples
comparison. Following a visual A/B check on the C++ build (rendered live from the device --
`img/fe_blend_on.gif` vs. `img/fe_blend_off.gif`/`img/fe_blend_comparison.gif`), those two
constants now default to their disabled values (0/256) on MicroPython, since the "Render path"
finding above -- full-frame fade dominating MicroPython's per-frame cost, ~3x slower than C++
once the work matches exactly -- makes this the more expensive side to carry on an interpreted
target. `render_frame()` takes an actual fast path when disabled (`fb.fill(0)` instead of
`fade_buffer()`'s per-pixel loop; a plain overwrite instead of `render_points()`'s per-point
blend, via the new `render_points_opaque()`). The C++ build is unaffected (`kPersistenceKeepQ8`/
`kElectronAlphaQ8` in `src/config/visual_constants.h` are still 160/240).

Both real fade/blend implementations are untouched and still bit-identical to the C++ formulas --
set `PERSISTENCE_KEEP_Q8 = 160` / `ELECTRON_ALPHA_Q8 = 240` back in `device_render_common.py` to
restore the matched-cost sweep the table above documents.

Re-ran `micropython/benchmark_test.py` (same board, same methodology, `frames_per_step=30`)
against this new default to confirm the expected speedup, not just the code-reading argument for
it:

**Orbital sweep (2p_z):**

`avg_compute_ms` (fade/proton/rotate-project-write, excluding blit) dropped ~85% at 500 points
(56.4ms -> 8.3ms atom, 53.1ms -> 6.3ms orbital) and ~73% at 8000 (78.3ms -> 21.4ms atom, 77.8ms
-> 21.2ms orbital) vs. the matched-cost table above -- the gap narrows at higher point counts
because per-point rotate/project/write cost (unavoidable, same in both builds) grows with point
count while the now-skipped full-frame fade stays flat, so it's a shrinking share of the total.

**FPS at production count (8000 points) vs. C++, before and after this change:**

| points | C++ atom fps | MPY atom fps (matched) | MPY atom fps (fast default) | C++ orbital fps | MPY orbital fps (matched) | MPY orbital fps (fast default) |
|-------:|-------------:|------------------------:|------------------------------:|-----------------:|----------------------------:|----------------------------------:|
|   8000 |        33.56 |                    10.94 |                          28.97 |             31.47 |                        11.00 |                              29.18 |

MicroPython went from ~3.1x slower than C++ to ~1.16x slower at the production point count --
`build_ms` (point-cloud sampling, unaffected by this change) is still the larger remaining gap
(e.g. 5224ms vs. C++'s 50ms at 8000 atom points -- see "Build/sampling path" above), not the
render loop.

### MicroPython point count (dimness investigation, 2026-08-27)

Live demo on-device looked visibly dimmer/sparser than the C++ build side by side. Three
compounding factors, chased down together rather than guessed at:

1. **Point count.** `N_POINTS` in `cloud_common.py`/`atom_view.py` was 3000, vs. C++'s
   `kOrbitalNumPoints`/`kAtomNumPoints` = 12000 -- a 4x density gap, the single biggest
   contributor to the sparse look.
2. **Fade/blend disabled by default** (see previous section) -- no persistence trail means each
   point is only ever lit for exactly one frame, so the same point count reads dimmer than a
   fading build even at equal density.
3. **Brighten-factor mismatch.** `OUTER_SHELL_BRIGHTEN` in `atom_cloud.py` was 0.3 vs. C++'s
   `kAtomOuterShellBrighten` = 0.4 -- outer-shell (valence) points, the ones most visible at a
   glance, were rendered dimmer than intended independent of the other two factors.

Bumping `N_POINTS` to the full 12000 to match C++ exactly was tried first and measured: atom
build/load time went from ~2.9s (3000 pts) to **16.4s (12000 pts)** on this board -- too slow for
the idle-cycling/element-switching feel of the live demo, since every switch re-samples and
re-builds the point cloud from scratch (the table-caching added earlier caches the *sampling
tables*, not the sampled point set itself, so this cost is paid every time regardless).

Settled on:
- `N_POINTS = 5000` (`cloud_common.py`, `atom_view.py`) -- roughly splits the gap, keeps
  build/load time in the low single-digit seconds, well short of C++'s 12000 but a meaningful
  density bump over the original 3000.
- `OUTER_SHELL_BRIGHTEN = 0.4` (`atom_cloud.py`) -- now matches `kAtomOuterShellBrighten` exactly.
- Fade/blend stays disabled by default (explicit decision, not revisited) -- the ~3x render-loop
  cost documented above isn't worth paying back just for the persistence-trail brightness effect.

Net effect: still fewer, non-fading points than C++, by design -- this is a deliberate
speed/density trade-off for the interpreted target, not an attempt to make MicroPython visually
identical to C++ at matched point count (that comparison is what the sweep tables above are for).

### Caveats / non-identical factors not chased down further

- Font rendering differs: C++ rasterizes a real typeface (Jersey10) into a proportional bitmap
  font (`src/render/font.cpp`); MicroPython uses `framebuf`'s built-in fixed 8x8 font. Both are
  bitmap fonts drawn pixel-by-pixel (same general cost order), and it's a small, point-count-
  -independent fixed cost either way (one title string + one scale-bar string per frame) -- not
  worth unifying just for this benchmark.
- `frames_per_step=30` on MicroPython vs 60 on C++, purely for capture-time budget; FPS already
  converges well before 60 samples at either count.
