/**
 * @file imu.h
 * @brief ESP-IDF driver for the QMI8658 6-axis IMU on the Waveshare ESP32-S3-LCD-1.3
 *        (SDA=47, SCL=48).
 *
 * Only the accelerometer is enabled/read -- tilt_gesture.h's detector only needs linear
 * acceleration, not gyro rate. Register map, init sequence, and scale factor (WHO_AM_I=0x6B/
 * 0x05, CTRL1/CTRL2/CTRL7, ACCEL_OUT@0x35, +-4g/8192 LSB-per-g) match
 * boards/QMI8658C_datasheet_rev_0.9.pdf's UI Register Overview table. Built on ESP-IDF's
 * `driver/i2c_master.h` peripheral driver (the standard bus/device handle API) rather than a
 * third-party component -- no dedicated ESP-IDF QMI8658 component exists, and this register
 * sequence is short enough not to need one.
