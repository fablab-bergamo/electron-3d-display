/**
 * @file orientation_tracker.h
 * @brief Accelerometer+gyroscope complementary-filter fusion driving the steady-state tumble
 *        camera (render/camera.h's CameraState), so tilting the physical board rotates the
 *        rendered atom/orbital like a real object held in the hand -- absolute orientation
 *        mapping, not rate/velocity control (see plans/bright-plotting-boole.md's rationale).
 *
 * Pitch and roll come from the accelerometer's gravity vector (atan2, absolute, no drift) with
 * gyroscope integration blended in between accelerometer samples for smoothness (a standard
 * complementary filter, see cfg.complementaryAlpha). Yaw has no absolute reference -- the
 * QMI8658 has no magnetometer -- so it's pure gyroscope integration and WILL drift; a slow
 * exponential pull toward zero (cfg.yawRecenterPerSecond) bounds that drift while stationary, at
 * the cost of also relaxing a deliberately-held yaw over tens of seconds. This is a deliberate
 * trade-off for a handheld toy, not a navigation-grade AHRS.
 *
 * Not a replacement for tilt_gesture.h's TiltGestureDetector: that stays the discrete
 * extreme-tilt navigation gesture (own accelerometer read, own baseline/thresholds). This class
 * only drives the continuous "look at it from this angle" rotation in atom_view.cpp's/
 * orbital_view.cpp's steady-state loop -- see their stepCamera() call sites.
