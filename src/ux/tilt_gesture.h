/**
 * @file tilt_gesture.h
 * @brief Tilt-and-hold gesture detector, built on imu.h's QMI8658 accelerometer readings.
 *
 * Not a nudge/shake detector (a short, sharp push) -- the interaction model is a sustained
 * tilt with confirm: calibrate the resting "planar" orientation once at boot, then treat a
 * large enough SUSTAINED deviation from that baseline as a direction candidate. An arrow
 * (drawTiltArrow() below) appears immediately so the user gets feedback that a direction was
 * recognized; the action only fires once that same tilt has been HELD for kHoldConfirmMs, at
 * which point poll() returns TiltPhase::kConfirmed exactly once (an edge, not a level) so
 * callers can react to it with a plain if/switch instead of debouncing themselves. Releasing
 * the tilt (dropping back near baseline) before the hold completes cancels the candidate with
 * no action taken.
 *
 * Direction matching is full-3D-vector cosine similarity, not "pick the single axis with the
 * largest raw deviation": that dominant-axis heuristic implicitly assumes the board's rest
 * ("planar") orientation lines up cleanly with a sensor axis, which the pyramid rig's actual
 * mount angle isn't guaranteed to do. Comparing the full normalized deviation vector against
 * each calibrated reference direction via dot product (the standard nearest-direction/
 * cosine-similarity classifier -- see e.g. NXP AN3461/ST DT0140's accelerometer-tilt
 * application notes) works regardless of how gravity happens to project onto the sensor's own
 * X/Y/Z axes at rest.
 *
 * Direction mapping is LEARNED on-device, not hardcoded: chooser.cpp's calibrateDirections()
 * runs a guided sequence at boot (before the real menu appears) that asks the user to
 * tilt-and-hold each of Right/Left/Up/Down in turn, using pollRaw() below (mapping-independent)
 * to capture each one's actual deviation vector, then calls setMapping() to record it as that
 * direction's reference. Until calibrated, every direction has no reference vector and poll()
 * reports no direction for any tilt -- a safe default, not a wrong-direction risk.
