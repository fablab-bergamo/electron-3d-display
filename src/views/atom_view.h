/**
 * @file atom_view.h
 * @brief Multi-electron atom point-cloud viewer.
 *
 * Shell-colored by principal quantum number n (valence subshell brightened, core dimmed),
 * per-element-renormalized scale (every element's outer subshell reaches the same on-screen
 * radius -- see atom_cloud.h's scaleForAtom()/kAtomTargetPx), per-shell-colored wrapped
 * electron-configuration title. Built on atom_cloud.h's model layer and camera.h's
 * render/fly-over pipeline; see orbital_view.h for the sibling hydrogen-orbital viewer this
 * mirrors. Unlike orbital_view.h, there's no point-turnover: atom_cloud's cloud is a mixture
 * of several subshells built once and stays static.
 *
 * Tilt-gesture controls (see tilt_gesture.h):
 *  - Up/Down tilt-hold: step through every element in periodic-table order
 *    (periodic_grid.h's periodicTableSnakeStep()), Down = forward, Up = backward.
 *  - Left tilt-hold: return to chooser.h's menu (runAtomView() returns).
 *  - Right tilt-hold: run the on-device shell dissection sequence
 *    (runDissectionSequence(), file-local to atom_view.cpp, built on atom_cloud.h's
 *    subshellDissectionPlan()) -- one hold automatically peels through every occupied
 *    subshell outer to inner, easing the camera in to frame each newly-revealed outermost
 *    remaining shell and holding briefly before moving to the next, then easing back to the
 *    full atom (holding there briefly before control returns). A second Right tilt-hold
 *    during the sequence cancels it early, easing straight back to the full atom the same
 *    way. Simplified relative to pc/atom_view_pc.py's PC dissection: whole shells are
 *    dropped as they're peeled away (rather than a camera-space half-clip cutaway -- no
 *    per-frame clip-plane test needed, and arguably clearer on a 240x240 panel), and there's
 *    no phase/sign coloring.
 *  - Also auto-advances to a random element after kViewIdleJumpUs (config/visual_constants.h)
 *    of no tilt input.
