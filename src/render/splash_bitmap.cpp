/**
 * @file splash_bitmap.cpp
 * @brief Boot splash / chooser-menu background, decoded on demand from data/atomic_cube.jpg.
 *
 * NOT a generated file (unlike the old splash_bitmap.cpp): that version pre-decoded the image
 * offline (tools/splash_gen/render_splash.py) into a ~112.5KB flash-resident RGB565 array
 * (240*240*2 bytes). This version keeps only the ~19KB JPEG in storage and decodes it at
 * runtime with TJpgDec, the JPEG decoder already present in the ESP32/ESP32-S3 ROM (jd_prepare/
 * jd_decomp -- see rom/tjpgd.h; confirmed linked unconditionally for both targets via each
 * chip's esp_rom component, not gated by any menuconfig option -- ESP_ROM_HAS_JPEG_DECODE is a
 * fixed SoC-capability flag, already =y in both boards' sdkconfig, not a switch to flip). Same
 * source code path on both targets.
 *
 * The JPEG is read from data/atomic_cube.jpg via the same "storage" SPIFFS partition every
 * other on-demand flash table already uses (see util/storage_mount.h, physics/hfs_radial.cpp,
 * physics/orbital_library.cpp) -- deployed by the `uploadfs` step already chained onto every
 * flash (tools/extra_script_uploadfs.py), so this costs nothing extra to build or deploy.
 *
 * The ROM decoder's output is fixed at RGB888 (3 bytes/pixel, not configurable from our side --
 * see rom/tjpgd.h's JD_FORMAT comment, baked in when the ROM itself was built), so jpegOutput()
 * below does the RGB888->RGB565 conversion by hand, through the same packColor565() bit formula
 * every other bitmap in this project uses.
 *
 * TJpgDec decodes one MCU block at a time (up to 16x16px here -- data/atomic_cube.jpg is 4:2:0
 * subsampled, confirmed via its SOF0 marker, and 240 is a multiple of 16 so every block is a
 * full 16x16, but jpegOutput() reads the actual JRECT bounds rather than assuming that). Each
 * decoded block is converted and written straight into the Display's own frame buffer via
 * writePx() -- NOT into an intermediate whole-image RGB565 buffer. An earlier version of this
 * file decoded into exactly such a buffer (240*240*2 = 115200 bytes) and cached it permanently
 * so ux/chooser.cpp's menu loop could keep re-blitting it without re-decoding every frame --
 * that buffer overflowed the CYD's internal DRAM at link time (`.dram0.bss` over budget by
 * ~73KB: no PSRAM on that board to redirect it to, unlike physics/orbital_library.cpp's
 * similarly-large sSampler table). The actual fix for the "re-decode every frame" cost turned
 * out to belong in chooser.cpp instead: it now only calls drawSplashScreen() again when the
 * background genuinely needs to reappear (menu (re-)entry), not on every blink poll -- see that
 * file's needsFullRedraw. That makes a 60-90ms decode-and-draw affordable there without needing
 * to cache anything at all here, on either target.
 *
 * RAM usage: the decode's own scratch (workPool below, ROM's JD_SZBUF stream buffer + Huffman/
 * quantization tables + the MCU sample buffer) is ~3.1KB per ChaN's documented minimum for a
 * color image; sized here at kWorkPoolSize with a little headroom, and freed (it's a function-
 * local static, but the point is nothing here scales with image size) as soon as
 * drawSplashScreen() returns. Nothing from a previous call is kept around.
