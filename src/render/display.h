 *        panel on the Waveshare ESP32-S3-LCD-1.3.
 *
 * All pixel colors in this project MUST be produced via packColor565() (or the palette
 * constants below, which are already packed). The panel's `esp_lcd_panel_dev_config_t` is
 * configured (see display.cpp) so that plain textbook RGB565 packing is correct on this
 * hardware -- no channel-swap or byte-swap compensation is needed in software.
