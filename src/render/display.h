/**
 * @file display.h
 * @brief ESP-IDF `esp_lcd` SPI bring-up and framebuffer management.
 *
 * Two targets share this file at compile time (CONFIG_IDF_TARGET_ESP32 branches below):
 * - Waveshare ESP32-S3-LCD-1.3: ST7789V2 240x240 panel, PSRAM available.
 * - CYD (ESP32-2432S028R, "Cheap Yellow Display"): ILI9341 240x320 panel, plain ESP32
 *   (Xtensa LX6), no PSRAM, internal SRAM fragmented into several non-contiguous heap
 *   regions at boot (see CYD-branch.md) -- driving the block-based frame buffer below.
 *
 * All pixel colors in this project MUST be produced via packColor565() (or the palette
 * constants below, which are already packed) and written through writePx()/blit() -- never
 * by poking a raw pointer. Storage byte order/row order is an internal Display concern (see
 * storageColor()/physicalRow()), not something callers need to know about.
